    <h1>AQA A-Level Economics: Calculation Questions Explained</h1>
<p>AQA A-Level Economics: Calculation Questions Explained</p><p>This guide walks you through the essential calculation questions from AQA Paper 1 (2020–2023), explaining how each answer is reached and why it's important for understanding economics in action!</p><h2>2020 – Q01 (The Circular Economy)</h2><ul><li>Question: What percentage of all plastics produced between 1950 and 2015 were either sent to landfill or incinerated?</li></ul><ul><li>Data Reference: Landfill + Incinerated = 5700m tonnes; Total = 8300m tonnes</li></ul><ul><li>Explanation:</li></ul><p>We divide the amount of plastic disposed of (5700) by the total produced (8300) and multiply by 100 to get a percentage:

(5700 / 8300) × 100 = 68.7%

This tells us that over two-thirds of plastic has been discarded, highlighting an urgent need for sustainable waste management.</p><h2>2020 – Q05 (Adult Social Care)</h2><ul><li>Question: How much does the median care worker earn for every £1 earned by the median worker in the whole economy?</li></ul><ul><li>Data Reference: Care Worker = £7.50; Whole Economy = £12.23</li></ul><ul><li>Explanation:</li></ul><p>To find this, divide the care worker's wage by the national median:

£7.50 / £12.23 = 0.6132… → Rounded = 61p

This shocking result means care workers earn just 61p for every £1 a typical worker earns—revealing stark inequality in vital sectors.</p><h2>2021 – Q01 (Pharmaceutical Industry)</h2><ul><li>Question: What was the average profit on a new drug in 2019, given development costs were $2.6 billion and the average return was 1.8%?</li></ul><ul><li>Data Reference: Profit = 1.8% of $2.6 billion</li></ul><ul><li>Explanation:</li></ul><p>We multiply the total investment by the return percentage:

$2.6bn × 0.018 = $46.8 million → Rounded = $47 million

This shows how thin profit margins can be, even in high-stakes industries like pharmaceuticals!</p><h2>2021 – Q05 (Ethnic Pay Gap)</h2><ul><li>Question: How much did a Bangladeshi worker earn on average in 2018, given a White British worker earned £28,677 and the pay ratio was 79.8%?</li></ul><ul><li>Data Reference: White British = £28,677; Pay ratio = 0.798</li></ul><ul><li>Explanation:</li></ul><p>£28,677 × 0.798 = £22,884

This quantifies the ethnic pay gap—an important issue in labour market economics and social policy.</p><h2>2022 – Q01 (Gig Economy)</h2><ul><li>Question: How many weekly gig workers were there per monthly gig worker in 2019?</li></ul><ul><li>Data Reference: Weekly = 9.6%; Monthly = 11.8%</li></ul><ul><li>Explanation:</li></ul><p>9.6 / 11.8 = 0.81356 → Rounded = 0.81

This ratio shows that for every monthly gig worker, only 0.81 did weekly work—indicating sporadic engagement in gig jobs.</p><h2>2022 – Q05 (Supermarket Sector)</h2><ul><li>Question: By what percentage was a basket of groceries more expensive at Waitrose compared to Lidl in April 2020?</li></ul><ul><li>Data Reference: Waitrose = £68.69; Lidl = £42.27</li></ul><ul><li>Explanation:</li></ul><p>[(£68.69 - £42.27) / £42.27] × 100 = 62.5%

This highlights the huge price difference between premium and discount retailers—useful for studying consumer choice and price elasticity!</p><h2>2023 – Q01 (Electric Cars and Batteries)</h2><ul><li>Question: What is the index value for car sales in 2021, based on a base year of 1.25 million sales and actual 2021 sales of 1.647181 million?</li></ul><ul><li>Data Reference: Base = 1.25m; Actual = 1.647181m</li></ul><ul><li>Explanation:</li></ul><p>(1.647181 / 1.25) × 100 = 131.77

This tells us car sales rose by 31.77% relative to the base—demonstrating strong growth in the electric vehicle sector.</p><h2>2023 – Q05 (In-Work Poverty)</h2><ul><li>Question: What is the difference between the mean and median growth in real pre-tax earnings from 1994 to 2017?</li></ul><ul><li>Data Reference: Mean = 34%; Median = 26%</li></ul><ul><li>Explanation:</li></ul><p>34% - 26% = 8 percentage points

This difference reveals growing income inequality, a key discussion point in labour economics.</p></body></html>
