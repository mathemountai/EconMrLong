      const questions = [
        {
          question: "What is the primary purpose of competition policy in markets?",
          options: [
            "To guarantee all firms make supernormal profits",
            "To prevent monopoly abuse and promote efficiency",
            "To ensure prices never change",
            "To eliminate all forms of government intervention"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "To prevent monopoly abuse and promote efficiency",
          explanation: "Example: When the EU fined Google €4.34 billion in 2018 for anti-competitive Android practices and the UK blocked Microsoft's acquisition of Activision over cloud gaming concerns in 2023, competition policy was used to maintain dynamic efficiency."
        },
        {
          question: "In a monopsony labor market, what characteristic distinguishes it from perfect competition?",
          options: [
            "Many buyers and sellers of labor",
            "A single buyer of labor with wage‑setting power",
            "Workers have complete control over wages",
            "Identical wages across all industries"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "A single buyer of labor with wage‑setting power",
          explanation: "Example: Amazon warehouses in small towns often act as monopsonies. In one case, a warehouse paid $12/hour when the local average was $15—well below the competitive level suggested by economic models."
        },
        {
          question: "What is the most likely outcome when a natural monopoly is privatized without regulation?",
          options: [
            "Immediate perfect competition emerges",
            "Fares rise significantly above inflation while service quality declines",
            "The monopoly automatically dissolves",
            "There are guaranteed efficiency gains"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "Fares rise significantly above inflation while service quality declines",
          explanation: "Example: When UK railways were privatized in the 1990s without proper regulation, some routes experienced fares rising 30% above inflation while service quality declined. Regulated privatizations such as Thames Water avoided these issues."
        },
        {
          question: "Which statement best describes the economic rationale for treating broadband as a public good?",
          options: [
            "It has zero opportunity cost of provision",
            "Its benefits extend beyond direct consumers (positive externalities)",
            "It perfectly fits the non‑excludable and non‑rival definitions",
            "Private markets always underprovide it due to free rider problems"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "Its benefits extend beyond direct consumers (positive externalities)",
          explanation: "Example: South Korea's heavy broadband investment (achieving 95% coverage) boosted GDP growth by 1.4% annually through telemedicine, remote education, and SME participation; in the UK, the Gigabit Broadband Voucher Scheme subsidizes rural connectivity."
        },
        {
          question: "What is the fundamental difference between wealth and income inequality?",
          options: [
            "Wealth measures annual earnings while income measures assets",
            "Income is a flow variable while wealth is a stock variable",
            "Only wealth inequality affects living standards",
            "Governments can only redistribute income, not wealth"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "Income is a flow variable while wealth is a stock variable",
          explanation: "Example: Elon Musk’s case (with over $200B in assets and a $0 salary) illustrates the stock‑flow distinction. In the UK, the top 10% own 43% of wealth despite narrower income differences."
        },
        {
          question: "What is the primary economic justification for government intervention in markets with negative externalities?",
          options: [
            "To increase producer surplus",
            "To internalize the external costs of traffic, pollution, and delays",
            "To guarantee firms make normal profits",
            "To eliminate all consumer surplus"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "To internalize the external costs of traffic, pollution, and delays",
          explanation: "Example: London's £15 Congestion Charge forces drivers to bear the social costs of congestion and pollution. Similarly, cigarette taxes help cover healthcare costs, and the EU’s carbon pricing reduced emissions by 21% since 2005."
        },
        {
          question: "In the context of price discrimination, which condition must hold for it to be effective?",
          options: [
            "Identical price elasticity of demand across all consumers",
            "Resale must be prevented between consumer groups",
            "A perfectly competitive market structure",
            "Government‑set price ceilings"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "Resale must be prevented between consumer groups",
          explanation: "Example: Student discounts work because resale is prevented—a 40‑year‑old cannot use a student ID to buy discounted tickets for resale. Airlines and Apple use similar measures to maintain pricing differences."
        },
        {
          question: "What best explains the concept of X‑inefficiency in firms?",
          options: [
            "Producing at a point inside the production possibility frontier",
            "Failure to minimize costs at a given output level",
            "Choosing an inappropriate production technology",
            "Operating on the wrong scale of production"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "Failure to minimize costs at a given output level",
          explanation: "Example: British Rail pre‑privatization incurred 30% higher staff costs per km than European peers due to bureaucratic slack, while Toyota's 'kaizen' approach enabled its NUMMI plant to be twice as productive as a comparable GM operation."
        },
        {
          question: "Which statement accurately describes the principal‑agent problem?",
          options: [
            "Consumers always know more than producers about product quality",
            "Managers may pursue personal goals rather than shareholder interests",
            "Government regulators always act in the public interest",
            "Workers have perfect information about their productivity"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "Managers may pursue personal goals rather than shareholder interests",
          explanation: "Example: Wells Fargo’s 2016 scandal and Boeing’s 737 MAX issues both illustrate how managers (agents) can have incentives that conflict with the interests of shareholders (principals)."
        },
        {
          question: "What is the key characteristic that distinguishes oligopoly from other market structures?",
          options: [
            "Many small firms producing identical products",
            "Interdependence in decision‑making",
            "Complete freedom of entry and exit",
            "Perfect information among all market participants"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "Interdependence in decision‑making",
          explanation: "Example: The UK supermarket sector shows interdependence – when Tesco launched 'Price Promise,' competitors quickly adjusted their strategies. Similar patterns occur in aviation and among OPEC members."
        },
        {
          question: "In third‑degree price discrimination, how do firms maximize profits?",
          options: [
            "By charging the same price to all customers",
            "By charging different prices based on demand elasticity",
            "By offering discounts only on bulk purchases",
            "By setting prices solely according to production cost"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "By charging different prices based on demand elasticity",
          explanation: "Example: Pharmaceutical companies charge significantly higher prices in one market (e.g., £10,000 for cancer drugs in the UK) compared to another (e.g., £100 in India), reflecting differences in consumers’ price sensitivity."
        },
        {
          question: "What is the most likely effect of a minimum wage set above equilibrium in a competitive labor market?",
          options: [
            "Unemployment falls for all workers",
            "Wages adjust to maintain full employment",
            "Youth unemployment rises while adult employment grows",
            "There is no impact on employment levels"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "Youth unemployment rises while adult employment grows",
          explanation: "Example: When the UK introduced the £7.20 National Living Wage in 2016, youth unemployment increased slightly while adult employment grew—demonstrating differential impacts on various groups."
        },
        {
          question: "Which factor would cause the demand curve for a product to shift to the right?",
          options: [
            "A decrease in consumer income",
            "An increase in consumer preference for the product",
            "A rise in the price of a complementary good",
            "Improved product substitutes"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "An increase in consumer preference for the product",
          explanation: "Example: When Beyond Meat entered the UK market, Tesco’s beef sales dropped as consumers switched to plant‑based alternatives; similarly, Netflix’s price hikes led to subscriber losses as consumers shifted their preferences."
        },
        {
          question: "What is the key difference between short‑run and long‑run production decisions?",
          options: [
            "In the short run, some factors are fixed while in the long run all factors are variable",
            "The short run involves only variable costs while the long run involves only fixed costs",
            "Firms do not plan for the long run",
            "In the long run, firms cannot change production capacity"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "In the short run, some factors are fixed while in the long run all factors are variable",
          explanation: "Example: During COVID, breweries repurposed existing equipment to produce hand sanitizer (a short‑run adjustment), while later building dedicated plants (a long‑run adjustment) demonstrated different planning horizons."
        },
        {
          question: "What does the term 'satisficing' describe in behavioral economics?",
          options: [
            "Optimizing to find the absolute best option",
            "Choosing an option that is 'good enough' rather than perfect",
            "Always selecting the cheapest alternative",
            "Following strict, rational decision‑making models"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "Choosing an option that is 'good enough' rather than perfect",
          explanation: "Example: Many shoppers stick with the same cereal brand for years rather than searching for the best deal every time; similarly, small businesses often set a target profit margin (e.g., 10%) instead of continually recalculating the optimal price."
        },
        {
          question: "What is a Pigouvian tax?",
          options: [
            "A tax imposed to correct a negative externality",
            "A subsidy given to firms producing positive externalities",
            "A tax on luxury goods to redistribute income",
            "A tariff on imported goods"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "A tax imposed to correct a negative externality",
          explanation: "Example: A carbon tax on fossil fuels forces producers to internalize the environmental damage they cause, thereby encouraging cleaner production methods."
        },
        {
          question: "Which of the following best describes deadweight loss in a market?",
          options: [
            "The loss of consumer surplus due to a decrease in supply",
            "The cost to society from inefficiency when equilibrium is not achieved",
            "The tax revenue collected by the government",
            "The increase in producer surplus from market intervention"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "The cost to society from inefficiency when equilibrium is not achieved",
          explanation: "Example: When a tax raises the price of a good, the reduction in quantity sold leads to a loss in total surplus – this lost value is known as deadweight loss."
        },
        {
          question: "What is the primary purpose of a subsidy in microeconomic theory?",
          options: [
            "To decrease consumer demand",
            "To reduce production costs and encourage higher output",
            "To restrict market entry",
            "To eliminate externalities"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "To reduce production costs and encourage higher output",
          explanation: "Example: Subsidies to renewable energy companies lower production costs, thereby encouraging increased output and a shift toward cleaner energy alternatives."
        },
        {
          question: "What does price elasticity of demand measure?",
          options: [
            "The responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price",
            "The effect of government regulation on market prices",
            "The change in total revenue due to a change in cost",
            "The responsiveness of supply to price changes"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "The responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price",
          explanation: "Example: If a 10% increase in price leads to a 20% drop in quantity demanded, the elasticity is 2, indicating high sensitivity."
        },
        {
          question: "Which statement best describes consumer surplus?",
          options: [
            "The difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay",
            "The extra profit producers earn above their costs",
            "The total tax revenue collected from consumers",
            "The difference between total revenue and total cost"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "The difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay",
          explanation: "Example: If a consumer is willing to pay $100 for a product but pays only $70, their consumer surplus is $30 – the extra value received from the transaction."
